I'm a tech enthusiast moving towards Security Analysis, professionally. I am actively looking for a job as a SOC analyst while studying CyberSecurity.

In my spare time I like to learn new stuff by playing with tech like raspberry Pis, Flipper zero, VMs. I also enjoy playing chess
and am a regular rock climber.
